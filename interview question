1.what is devops ? Day -1
--------------------------------
Devops is a process that makes our application to deliver to the client in a quicker manner by ensuring
that there is a proper automation,testing,quality and monitoring takes place this is known as devops
why devops ?
--------------------------------
it will improve your application delivery and also done need of multiple teams to evolve in this process
the only devops will handle testing,monitoring,and quality check 
before 10 years we dont have devops enginners in the market and we have multiple teams to do this things
and the teams are 
*system administors
* build and release enginner
* testers
instead of having these all teams we have devops engineers to do all this things in a quick manner

3. what is soft development life cycle (SDLC) ?
The software development is basically having the six stages that are
planing : here is the first step of sdlc that we getting the inputs from the customer and businnes analyst are responsible for this 
defining : defining is nothing but the whatever the inputs we got from the client we are going to do that in documentary
designing : and the designing are of two type low level design and high level designing where we can design our application in this step
building : building is nothing but the here the developers will write a code according to the planning and defining and designing and build the application and deployed in their own laptops or systems
testing : here is the main step in sdlc that while getting the code from the developers the testers will test the application in the local server 
deployment : and finally the deployment will be done in the production or pre-production
and as a devops enginner u will be evaluate in three stages building,testing,and deploying the application through automation
and as a deveops enginner we wont involve in any steps of sdlc but we will fasten the code to the client
